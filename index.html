    <h1> About </h1>
    I work as a cryptographic engineer at <a href=https://boltlabs.tech>Bolt Labs</a>, developing protocols and open-source software that use secure computation to enable financial privacy.

    <p>
    I received my PhD in 2021 from the <a href="https://dsl.cis.upenn.edu/">Distributed Systems Lab</a> at the University of Pennsylvania, where I was advised by <a href=https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~nadiah/>Nadia Heninger</a>.  
    My research focused on secure multi-party computation (MPC) as it transitions from a theoretical academic construct into a practical tool for privacy preserving data computations.
    
    I spent summer 2020 at Microsoft Research, working with Hao Chen at the <a href=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/cryptography-research/>Cryptography and Privacy Research</a> group
    and summer 2019 at Boston University, working with <a href=https://sail.bu.edu>SAIL</a> on <a href=https://github.com/multiparty/jiff/>JIFF</a>, a framework for MPC.

    <p>
    I've been a teaching assistant for many courses at the University of
    Pennsylvania and Tufts University.
      <ul>
        <li> CIS 331: Introduction to Networks and System Security, Spring 2017
        <li> CIS 556: Cryptography, Fall 2016
        <li> COMP 170: Theory of Computation, Spring 2015
        <li> COMP 50: Problem-Solving by Computer, Fall 2013
        <li> COMP 11: Introduction to Computer Science, Fall 2012 - Spring 2015
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
    I developed coursework for the computer science workshop portion of <a href=https://www.seas.upenn.edu/awe/gems/>GEMS 2017</a>, a summer camp for middle-school girls interested in engineering, math, and science. 
    </p>

    <h1> Other </h1>
    <p>
    A variety of research and non-research projects can be found on my <a href="http://github.com/marsella">Github</a> page, including general notes, teaching materials, and an assortment of half-finished hackathon projects.
    </p>

    <p>
    My hobbies include fitness in several forms and fabric engineering.
