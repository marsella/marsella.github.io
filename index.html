    I'm a cryptography engineer (or perhaps an applied cryptographer).
    My professional interests include implementation of secure, misuse-resistant cryptographic protocols in Rust, security analysis of protocol designs and implementations, and generally contributing to the ecosystem of open-source privacy-enhancing tools available to users.
    I'm particularly focused on secure multi-party computation; my dissertation focused on general-purpose MPC software developed in academia and my recent work includes development on <a href="https://github.com/boltlabs-inc/tss-ecdsa">a threshold ECDSA signing scheme</a>.

    <p>
    Outside of work, I read books, work out (lifting, running, and bouldering), and go outside. I also enjoy occasional craft projects and <a href="https://www.majos.net/">this website</a>.
    </p>

    <h1>Work experiences</h1>
    I currently work as a research engineer at <a href=https://galois.com>Galois</a>, addressing problems related to secure computation. Previously, I was a cryptographic engineer at <a href=https://boltlabs.tech>Bolt Labs</a>, developing protocols and open-source software that use secure computation to enable financial privacy. You can see some of this work via <a href="http://github.com/marsella">my GitHub page</a>.

    <p>
    I received my PhD in 2021 from the <a href="https://dsl.cis.upenn.edu/">Distributed Systems Lab</a> at the University of Pennsylvania, where I was advised by <a href=https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~nadiah/>Nadia Heninger</a>.  
    My research focused on secure multi-party computation (MPC) as it transitions from a theoretical academic construct into a practical tool for privacy preserving data computations.
    
    I spent summer 2020 at Microsoft Research, working with Hao Chen at the <a href=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/cryptography-research/>Cryptography and Privacy Research</a> group
    and summer 2019 at Boston University, working with <a href=https://sail.bu.edu>SAIL</a> on <a href=https://github.com/multiparty/jiff/>JIFF</a>, a framework for MPC.
